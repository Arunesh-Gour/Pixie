======================= ==========

Schedule
========
Duration
--------
The project was intended to be completed within 2 months from the date of
assignment.

Schedule varience
-----------------
Project actually took 1 month or less to complete, from the date of starting
work on the project.

Reason for varience
-------------------
Varience of 1 month was observed in the project completion as the project is
simple and is limited in scope.

Change management
=================
:Total changes: 1.

Impact of changes
-----------------
Changes impacted project by reducing size, complexity and scope of the
project by huge amounts.

Highlight of changes
--------------------
Instead of originally thought neural network based project, the architecture
was reduced to simplex agent given the fact that it was a mini project
and the time required by neural networks is a lot.

Quality management
==================
:Total defects: 2.

Reason for defects
------------------
1. Simplex agent is not good enough to track and update to user's nature easily
   and given that this is a simplex agent, it has low to no user history,
   i.e. low to no memory for tracking user requirements from past data.
2. Low memory for user activity tracking causes the system to be able to
   perform only simple tasks.

Risk / issue management
=======================
Risks
-----
1. In-efficient in securing homes.
2. Inoperability during power failures.

Issues
------
1. Simplex AI agent - less efficient and smart.
2. Poor cross-platform operation - needs external drivers.
3. Complexity of initial house configuration / setup.

Impact
------
1. Security issues while locking door from insecure application / driver.
2. Status querying error if power outage during any operation.
3. Issues connecting to / from other devices - needs external drivers.

Human resource management
=========================
1. 5 people for mini project were sufficient.
2. All the members had right set of skills needed to complete the project.
3. Training was provided in the form of class lectures, which helped complete
   the project efficiently, and effectively.

Organisation structure
======================
1. Everyone collaborated with each other well.
2. Decision makers responded to queries and call within 1 hour from the time
   of request.
3. Members were available during working hours + feasible time, except for
   personal time, as planned by team.
4. All issues were addressed quickly and no complicated issue arose during
   entire duration of the project.

Communication management
========================
Communication plan
------------------
1. Each member had access to communicate to any member freely, as per their
   availability.
2. For working hours, members can call or drop a message as per their
   mutual understanding.
3. For odd / off hours, members can only drop a message and the responders
   can reply as per their availability.
4. For any urgent messages, members can call required members directly.

Plan implementation
-------------------
Plan was a huge success as it solved various issues of communication, and
management.

Feedback
========
Summary
-------
Feedback was gathered using internal testing, within team members only.
All members responded positively regarding the working, except for the
part where complex tasks were not considered as project's scope didn't
allow for complex tasks by the agent.

Trends
------
The theme of feedback revolved around project's inability to carry out
complex tasks at the moment, and the length and time consumed during initial
house configuration / setup, though it is just a stub for real IoT devices.

People often said that "complexity in this project would be more beneficial".

Opportunities
-------------
1. Expanding project's scope to much more complex tasks, using advanced
   algorithms.
2. Shortening and simplification of initial house configuration / setup.
3. Expansion of project scope.

Lesson Learned
==============
1. Importance of using project plan for development.
2. Need for documentation.
3. Role of complex agents and simple agents in a project.
4. Security comes first in any application.

Others
======
Duration and effort / phase
---------------------------
1. Pre-planning: 20% effort.
   This phase included planning about project structure, models,
   scope, and lot more.

2. Brainstorming: 30% effort.
   This phase included fitting ideas together in efficient and effective
   manner.

3. Development: 40% effort.
   This phase included coding and implementation part only.

4. Documentation and reports: 10% effort.
   This phase included all documentations, from initial to final / closure
   report.

Benefits realized
-----------------
1. Efficient resource and time utilization.
2. Better teamworking skills.
3. More insights to AI project development.

Benchmark comparisions
----------------------
* This project offers simple, minimal user interface with one-time interaction.
* It is fully automated and required no interaction from the user except
  initial house configuration / setup.
* Provides easy one glance system status monitoring.
* Real-time system status, monitoring and decision making.
* Fast & secure.

Although the project have multiple benifits over traditional house automation
systems, this project does not aims or intends to replace them. But instead,
it serves as an add-on or extension or controller system for them.

Executive summary
=================
Project summary
---------------
Problem
   * Smart devices used in home automation generally use more resources than
     intended, mostly because they are powered on indefinitely.
   * On many occasions, people have a very busy schedule due to which they
     forget to turn off devices, leading to heavy bills, depletion of limited
     resources, etc.
   * Due to such busy schedules, there are many instances of people forgetting
     to close the doors or secure their house properly before leaving.
   * Due to complex interfaces, people often face difficulties in operating and
     maintaining home automation devices.

Purpose
   To solve existing problems while keeping things simple and easy.

Description
   This project solves the issue of limited resources by conserving low
   power owing to low-end devices, while keeping scope and algorithm simple,
   free and open source.

Background
----------
This project is a part of AI home automation systems.
High power / resource usage by many automation systems, and the need for
quick and easy automation led to the creation of this project.

Process
-------
1. Only closed group members were involved in this project as this is a group
   project.
2. Every member contributed to the project as this is the collaborative idea of
   each involved.
3. Every member contributed equally in all phases of development - from
   documentation to implementation.
4. This project was completed in a duration of 1 month, from the date of
   starting.

Results / Conclusions
---------------------
The project successfully resolved the key issue for which the project was
intended for.
It can be used in almost all situations of home / office where there is a
need to conserve resources, which are being misused due to lack of
people's attention or due to busy and un-predictable issues.

Recommendations
---------------
Though the project successfully resolved key issues for which the project
was intended, there is still a need to improve algorithms and agents to
enable it to perform many complex tasks rather than being stuck at performing
simple tasks.

Hence, future updates will follow which will bring out changes in algorithms
like use of Deep neural networks, better interfaces, more simplification, etc.
