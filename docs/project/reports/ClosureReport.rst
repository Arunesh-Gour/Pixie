:Report details: Final project report.
:Time / date: 21 April 2021, Wednesday.
:Project title: Pixie.
:Project category: AI Home Automation.

Description
===========
Smart AI home automation project, capable of controlling various smart devices
in home to suit the needs of the user to provide maximum comfort while
keeping the resource usage low.
Smartly controls the various home devices like fans, lights, tv, and door.

Schedule
========
Duration
--------
The project was intended to be completed withing 2 months from the date of
assignment.

Schedule varience
-----------------
Project actually took 1 month or less to complete, from the date of starting
work on the project.

Reason for varience
-------------------
Varience of 1 month was observed in the project completion as the project is
simple and is limited in scope.

Change management
=================
:Total changes: 1.

Impact of changes
-----------------
Changes impacted project by reducing size, complexity and scope of the
project by huge amounts.

Highlight of changes
--------------------
Instead of originally thought neural network based project, the architecture
was reduced to merely simple agent given the fact that it was a mini project
and the time required by neural networks is a lot.

Quality management
==================
:Total defects: 2.

Reason for defects
------------------
1. Simple agent is not good enough to track and update to user's nature easily
   and given that this agent utilizes simple agent, it has low user history,
   i.e. low memory for tracking user requirements from past data.
2. Low memory for user activity tracking causes the system to be able to
   perform only simple tasks.

Risk / issue management
=======================
Risks
-----
1. Security in door locking.
2. Mid-way stuck due to power issues.

Issues
------
1. Low-end IoT devices.
2. Poor connectivity on cross-platforms.
3. Internet availability and security.

Impact
------
1. Security issues while locking door from insecure application / driver.
2. Status querying error if power outage midway during any operation.
3. Issues connecting from other devices.

Human resource management
=========================
1. 5 people for mini project were sufficient.
2. All the members had right set of skills needed to complete the project.
3. Training was provided in the form of class lectures, which helped complete
   the project efficiently, and effectively.

Organisation structure
======================
1. Everyone collaborated with each other well.
2. Decision makers responded to queries and call within 1 hour from the time
   of request.
3. Members were available during working hours + feasible time, except for
   personal time, as planned by team.
4. All issues were addressed quickly and no complicated issue arose during
   entire duration of the project.

Communication management
========================
Communication plan
------------------
1. Each member had access to communicate to any member freely, as per their
   availability.
2. For working hours, members can call or drop a message as per their
   mutual understanding.
3. For odd / off hours, members can only drop a message and the responders
   can reply as per their availability.
4. For any urgent messages, members can call required members directly.

Plan implementation
-------------------
Plan was a huge success as it solved various issues of communication, and
management.

Feedback
========
Summary
-------
Feedback was gathered using internal testing, within team members only.
All members responded positively regarding the working, except for the
part where complex tasks were not considered as project's scope didn't
allow for complex tasks by the agent.

Trends
------
Theme resolved around "complexity in prject would be more helpful and
better".

Opportunities
-------------
1. Development of more complex agent by expanding the capabilities of this
   project.
2. More people will adopt the project if scope is expanded.

Lesson Learned
==============
1. Importance of using project plan for development.
2. Need for documentation.
3. Role of complex agents and simple agents in a project.
4. Security comes first in any application.

Others
======
Duration and effort / phase
---------------------------
1. Pre-planning: 20% effort.
   This phase included planning about project structure, models,
   scope, and lot more.

2. Brainstorming: 30% effort.
   This phase included fitting ideas together in efficient and effective
   manner.

3. Development: 40% effort.
   This phase included coding and implementation part only.

4. Documentation and reports: 10% effort.
   This phase included all documentations, from initial to final / closure
   report.

Benefits realized
-----------------
1. Efficient resource and time utilization.
2. Better teamworking skills.
3. More insights to AI project development.

Benchmark comparisions
----------------------
Other project often are too complex and are generally paid or require more
resources and power to function. While, our project is self developed, open
source, free, uses limited resources, and can be implemented quickly
anywhere.

Executive summary
=================
Project summary
---------------
Problem
   The main issue was that existing projects either use a lot of power
   to manage smart devices or lacks simple operations and simplicity.

Purpose
   To solve existing problems while keeping things simple and easy.

Description
   This project solves the issue of limited resources by conserving low
   power owing to low-end devices, while keeping scope and algorithm simple,
   open and free.

Background
----------
This project is a part of AI home automation systems.
High power / resource usage by many automation systems, and the need for
quick and easy automation led to the creation of this project.

Process
-------
1. Only class members were involved in this project as this is a group project.
2. Every member contributed to the project as this is the collaborative idea of
   each involved.
3. Every member contributed equally in all phases of development - from
   documentation to implementation.
4. This project was completed in a duration of 1 month, from the date of
   starting.

Results / Conclusions
---------------------
The project successfully resolved the key issue for which the project was
intended for.
It can be used in almost all situations of home / office where there is a
need to conserve resources, which are being misused due to lack of
people's attention or due to busy and un-predictable issues.

Recommendations
---------------
To make this project great, it will be made open and available to all at no
cost.
